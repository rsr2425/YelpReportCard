# YelpReportCard
This project contains a simple web-based tool that can score provided reviews based on the text of the reviews. Users provide reviews, which then get assigned a letter grade in several different categories.

The backend is run using an API developed with Django that accepts reviews and grades them if grades haven't been assigned, while the frontend is a simple React app that allows the user to see reviews previously submitted and submit new reviews.

## WIP/Long-term Goal
Longer-term, this web app will be adapted so that users can specify the link of a yelp profile and get grades generated for several different categories based on the test of the reviews.
